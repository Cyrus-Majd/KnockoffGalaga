# KnockoffGalaga
A really really really simplified version of the classic arcade game Galaga. Written with HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

This game seemed fun and I wanted to see how difficult it would be to recreate it with javascript. It turns out to be a lot more work than it looks. Making this was pretty fun, though. There's not much else to say. I'll be hosting this on my website as well if anyone wants to play it. It's very simple, just initialize the ships and hit the "shoot" buttons to fire projectiles at the enemy. Make sure you bring the enemy's health down to zero to win! Have fun!
